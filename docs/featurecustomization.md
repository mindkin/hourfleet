## Software is Expensive

Software is expensive stuff to write, and to maintain. It is very likely that you are using Hourfleet for this very reason, because it's simply too expensive to build and maintain the entire codebase yourself. By using Hourfleet, you share software build and maintenance costs with other Hourfleet users via your monthly subscription. This is the cornerstone value proposition of SaaS businesses.  

Our team works really hard to capture improvement ideas from the Hourfleet community, and to use these to guide our product design and build processes. You can see evidence of this at our [feedback site](http://feedback.hourfleet.com). Product improvements curated in this way are delivered to you as part of your Hourfleet subscription. There is no additional charge.

## Focusing on the problem, not the solution  

Occasionally customers describe a need they believe is unique to them, and usually go on to describe how they see the solution implemented. Our approach here is to understand the root issue that is being adressed really, really well. And only then start to consider solutions. Our preference is to build a solution that is generically suitable for all Hourfleet customers, one that can be delivered to you at no additional cost.

## Customization  

Very ocassionally we may contemplate a unique customization for your Hourfleet car share. The two most common instances are: 

- If your business operating in a country that is not currently supported by [Stripe](https://stripe.com/global) then you may ask us to build support for a local payment provider.

- If you want to implement a non-Hourfleet in-car technology to manage keyless unlock and/or telemetry data.  

The general principles we apply are:

- Any such work will be covered by an exchange of emails that form the basis of the work we undertake for you.

- We will provide an estimate of the cost to implement your customization. This is calculated based on our standard hourly rate, and it reprtesents our best estimate based on the information available to us. The actual fee may vary, and we commit to work with you to minimize any overruns.

- Once the work has been implemented a monthly surcharge equavalent to 1.75% of the customization fee will be added to your monthly subscription
