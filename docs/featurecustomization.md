## Software is Expensive

Software is expensive stuff to write, and to maintain. It is very likely that you are using Hourfleet for this very reason, because it's simply too expensive to build and maintain the entire codebase yourself. By using Hourfleet, you share software build and maintenance costs with other Hourfleet users via your monthly subscription. This is the cornerstone value proposition of SaaS businesses.  

Another part of the SaaS value proposition is that you get to benefit from Hourfleet improvements over time. Our team works really hard to capture your ideas, and to use these to guide our product design and build processes. You can see evidence of this at our [feedback site](http://feedback.hourfleet.com). Product improvements curated in this way are delivered to you as part of your Hourfleet subscription. There is no additional charge.

## Focusing on the problem, not the solution  

Occasionally customers describe a need they believe is unique to them, and usually go on to describe how they see the solution implemented. Our approach here is to understand the core issue really, really well, and only then to start considering solutions. Our preference is to build a solution that is generically suitable for all Hourfleet customers, one that can be delivered to you as part of your existing Hourfleet subscription.

## Customization  

Very ocassionally we may contemplate a unique customization for your Hourfleet car share. The two most common instances are: 

- If your business operating in a country that is not currently supported by [Stripe](https://stripe.com/global) then you may ask us to build support for a local payment provider.

- If you want to implement a non-Hourfleet in-car technology to manage keyless unlock and/or telemetry data.  

The general principles we apply are:

1 Any such work will be scoped by an exchange of emails that form the basis of the work we undertake for you. Unless explicity varied, Hourfleet's standard [Terms of Serice](https://www.wix.hourfleet.com/terms) continue to apply.

1 We will provide an estimate of the cost to implement your customization. This is calculated based on our standard hourly rate, and it reprtesents our best estimate based on the information available to us at the time. The actual fee may vary. We commit to work with you to minimize any overruns.

1 Once the work has been implemented a monthly surcharge equavalent to 1.75% of the customization fee will be added to your monthly subscription. This reflects the truth that all software product creates ongoing cost for the owner.

1 All intellectual property rights pertaining to the customization(s) are vested in Mindkin Ltd, the owners of Hourfleet
