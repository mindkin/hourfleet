# Network Connectivity
The Hourfleet carkit operates as a telemetry device, connecting to a 2G mobile data network so that car door instructions can be received from the Hourfleet network, and telemetry data can be transferred to the Hourfleet network. 
The general requirements for this connection are
-	2G coverage over the geographic areas where Hourfleet-enabled cars are expected to travel
-	A monthly data plan which supports 50Mb/month, and inbound SMS messaging
-	A standard size data SIM that has an APN pre-configured in PDP context #1.
