# Network Connectivity
The Hourfleet carkit operates as a telemetry device, connecting to a 2G mobile data network so that car door instructions can be received from the Hourfleet network, and telemetry data can be transferred to the Hourfleet network. 

It will be important for you to work with your chosen carrier to ensure your carkits work correctly. Before launching your network, we suggest you confirm:
-	Your carrier has 2G coverage over the geographic areas where Hourfleet-enabled cars are expected to travel
-	You can purchase monthly data plan which supports 50Mb/month, and inbound SMS messaging. Telemetry-style data plans should cost your business less than $US4/month
-	Your carrier can supply a standard size data SIM which  has an APN pre-configured in PDP context #1. An APN is a bit like a 'carrier internal' DNS server. The mobile data network uses the APN to decide how the carkit will be allocated a real-world IP address. SIM cards many have one of more APNs pre configured. The carkit uses the APN defined as #1
