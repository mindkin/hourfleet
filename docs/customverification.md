# Custom Verification

Hourfleet has a rich verification system. Car borrowers, car owners and cars each have a number of verifications that must be in place before a rental can take place. These verifications include things like phone, email, drivers' licence and more.

In addition to these in-built verifications, you can configure and describe one general verification for your customers to comply with before you manually verify them. This could be directing them to upload their Driving Record (Canada), or their Insurance Certificate (USA). 

To create a custom verification:
1. Sign in using your master account  
1. Navigate to My Car Share --> Settings, and expand Business Model.

1. Switch 'Auto Verify' off
1. Add your verification heading
1. Add the verification instructions which guide your customers. Note that you can include links as shown
1. Scroll to the bottom of the pace and click 'Save Changes'

That it!

Your customers will now be guided to follow your verification instructions when they register.
