# Insurance  
Having the right insurance product is an essential part of running a car sharing service. The range of insurance producs available to you will depend on how well local insurance companies support car sharing services. In many jurisdictions conventional business-to-consumer car sharing can be insured with products designed for the car rental industry. Support for peer-to-peer car sharing is quite varied, so you'll need to shop around.  

Hourfleet has been designed with a couple of insurance-specific features. These include
- Allowing you to give your insurance provider a secure signin so they can view basic details of past bookings. They have access to the renter contacts details and date/time of the trip.  
- Allow you to enter in a revenue share arrangement with your insurer. This may obviate the need for an annual premium, allowing you to buy cover for on-rental risk based on actual usage.
