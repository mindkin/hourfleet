#  How Things Work

Typically, your business is already going to have its own website and landing pages where you attract, advertise and track and convert your customers. This website is likely to have information such as: Pricing Plans, Fees, Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Customer Case Studies, Company Info and others. We will refer to these pages of your website as the 'Landing Pages' of your business.

As a tenant on the Hourfleet platform, you will get a branded web app of your own that will look and feel like your website and landing pages. But this web app will have a different URL than your landing page. It will be hosted for you at: https://yourcompanyname.hourfleet.com. 

## Website Integration

This web app is where your customers will manage their account with your network, manage their profile and where they will book/reserve and list cars.

The web app you get on Hourfleet will not be able to provide things to your users like: your Terms of Service or Privacy policy, etc, but instead it will provide the ability to link users to those things on your own landing pages from various appropriate places in the web app.

The list of links on the web app to your website are:

* Home (Landing Page) - the user is returned here after logging out of the web app
* Terms Of Service - the user is directed here to read your terms of service, generally when being asked to accept them.
* Privacy Policy - the user is directed here to read your privacy policy in places where infromation is taken from them.
* How It Works - the user is directed here to read about how your network works, and reads any information specific to how your network works.
* About - you can provide information about about your business or people
* Contact - you can provide information for contacting the people and services of your business  
* Fees - you can provide pricing and fees information
* Documentation - A place you can provide additional documentation, like forms, etc.

An example of the web app with these links in the footer can be seen here.

All of these links (except the 'Home'link) are optional, and will be shown if configured, and hidden if not configured. See [You Configure](http://docs.hourfleet.com/youconfigure.html) for techical details.

### Support Page

In addition to the pages above, the web app offers you a pre-formatted 'Support' page that displays support contact information and insurance information for your customers to use when they need assitance using the web app, or assistance when borroing cars out on the road. 

This support page is pre-formatted with infromation you provide in your tenancy configuration. An example can be seen here.

## Hosted Environment

* Where your asssets are hosted, and how they are deployed
* Where your data is hosted, and how it is managed
* Access to your data

## Operational Management

The Hourfleet web app includes a number of administration pages for your business to help you operate and monitor your car sharing network.

You can nominate one or more people in your business to manage your business in the web app.
Those people will log into the web app just like your customers, but they will have access to a number of tools that your customers will not have access to.

These tools include the ability to:

* Monitor activity on your network, such as when new users register, when users create bookings, etc.
* Manage your user accounts and their verifications.
* Manage the charging and remitance of your customers.
* Configure, manage and test your physical keyless devices.
