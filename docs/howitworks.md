#  How Things Work

Typically, your car sharing business is already going to have its own website and landing pages where you attract, advertise and track and convert your customers. 

Your website is likely to have information such as: Pricing Plans, Fees, Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Customer Case Studies, Company Info and other information, typically in multiple pages (URL's). For the purposes of this documentation, we will refer to these pages of your website as the 'Landing Pages' of your car sharing business.

As a tenant on the Hourfleet platform, you will get a branded web app of your own that will look and feel like your website and landing pages. But this web app will have a different URL than your landing page. 

Your Hourfleet web app will be hosted for you at: https://yourcompany.hourfleet.com.

## Web App Integration

The Hourfleet web app is where your customers will manage their account with your car sharing network, manage their profile, and they will book/reserve and list cars there too. Basically, they do everything with cars on the web app.

The Hourfleet web app however will not be able to provide things to your customers like: your Terms of Service or Privacy policy, etc.. But instead, it will provide the ability to link users to those things on the landing pages of your own website, from various links in the Hourfleet web app.

The list of links in the web app that link to your website are:

* Home (Landing Page) - the user is returned here after logging out of the web app.
* Terms Of Service - the user is directed here to read your terms of service, generally when being asked to accept them.
* Privacy Policy - the user is directed here to read your privacy policy in places where infromation is taken from them.
* How It Works - the user is directed here to read about how your network works, and reads any information specific to how your network works.
* About - you can provide information about about your business or people
* Contact - you can provide information for contacting the people and services of your business  
* Fees - you can provide pricing and fees information
* Documentation - A place you can provide additional documentation, like forms, etc.

An example of the links in the Hourfleet web app can be seen in the footer section of the web app. It looks something like this:

<< screenshot of standard footer with all links >>

All of the links in the list above (except the 'Home' link) can be optionally configured, and hidden if not configured. See [You Configure](http://docs.hourfleet.com/youconfigure.html) for the technical details.

> Note: The 'Home' link must always be defined.

### Customer Support Page

In addition to all the pages above, the Hourfleet web app offers you a ready made pre-formatted 'Support' page that displays support contact information and insurance information for your customers to use when they need assistance using the web app, or assistance when borrowing cars out on the road. 

This support page is pre-formatted with information you provide in your tenancy configuration. An example of the support page can be seen here.

## Operational Management

The Hourfleet web app includes a number of administration pages to help you operate and monitor your car sharing network.

You can nominate one or more people in your business to manage your business in the web app. Those people will log into the web app just like your customers, but they will have access to a number of tools that your customers would not see and not have access to.

These tools include the ability to:

* Monitor activity on your network, such as when new users register, when users create bookings, etc.
* Manage your user accounts and their verifications.
* Manage the charging and remitance of your customers.
* Configure, manage and test your physical keyless devices.

> Note: Hourfleet is constantly striving to provide its customers with the most relevant tools for managing your network. So please let us know what is missing and we will try to provide you the best experience for managing your network.
