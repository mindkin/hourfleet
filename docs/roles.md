## Roles
Your Hourfleet tenancy has four main roles, and each role as distinct activities and responsibilities. It is important to remember that sometimes the same person may have several concurrent roles. The roles are:

- Network Operator - The administrator of your car sharing network
- Car Owner - The designated owner of a car
- Car Borrower - The customer to reserves and rents a car
- Insurance Provider - The person representing the Network Operato's insurance provider  

Many of each roles' responsibilities are time-critical, and some of these have automated events that take place in the absence of any activity from the role owner. For example, when a Car Renter finishes a booking the Car Owner then has a configurable length of time in order to complete the booking, noting the condition of the car and rating the Car Renter. In the absence of this action, Hourfleet will automatically complete that booking.
