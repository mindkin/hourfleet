# First Steps

We're keen to see you get value for money from your Hourfleet subscription. So before you open the doors on your new Car Share and tell your customers about it, there some important things you'll need to understand, and a few things you'll need to do first. 

1. **Consider your Business plan, marketing, customer care and insurance.** It should come as no surprise that having a great platform like Hourfleet is only a very small part of your business success. If you're establishing a car sharing business then you're going to need to spend plenty of time on these things. You can work on them while you prepare your Hourfleet Car Share as guided below.

1. **Understand your Hourfleet Car Share.** You will need your own business website landing page. You will need to host, create and maintain this website yourself (e.g. https://mybusiness.com). You can bespoke build this site, or use tools like [Squarespace](http://squarespace.com), [Wix](http://wix.com) or many others. Either way, you will need this site as your front door to attract your customers. The site is also required to host a few images, and pages of information like: your Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, etc. These pages will then be linked from the Hourfleet App so that your customers can move between your site and the Hourfleet App seemlessly. 

1. **Create your Account** You will need to sign up for an account with your own Car Share. As an onwer of the Car Share you will be given special permissions which gives you access to operate the Car Share. You will have exclusive access to the 'Operators Dashboard' a page where you can manage and monitor your customers, cars and carkits.

1. **Customizing your Hourfleet Tenancy.** There are a large number of [configuration options](http://docs.hourfleet.com/configure.html) which help you establish the Branding, SEO, Business Model, and other Settings which underpin how your Car Share software works and behaves. You will definately want the Hourfleet App that your customers use to look as close to your brand as possible, and for it to be easily searchable on the web.  

1. **Integrations.** The most important integration is with [Stripe.com](http://stripe.com). Specific instructions are [here](http://docs.hourfleet.com/integrations.html). Hourfleet will need to integrate with your Stripe account, to charge your customers for their subscriptions and for using cars. Sign up with Stripe and create restricted keys for Hourfleet to use to charge your customers on your behalf.
