# Checklist  

We're keen to see you get value for money from your Hourfleet subscription. So before you sign up, there some important things you'll need to understand, and a few things you'll need to do. 

1. **Business plan, marketing, customer care and insurance.** It should come as no surprise that having a great platform like Hourfleet is only a very small part of your business success. If you're establishing a car sharing business then you're going to need to spend plenty of time on these things. You can work on them while you prepare your Hourfleet tenancy as guided below.

1. **Understanding an Hourfleet Tenancy.** You will need to host, create and maintain [your own landing page](yoursite.html) which are unique to your business. You can bespoke build this, or use tools like [Squarespace](http://squarespace.com), [Wix](http://wix.com) or others.

1. **Configuring your Hourfleet Tenancy.** These are a large number of [configuration options](http://docs.hourfleet.com/configure.html) which help you establish the branding, business rules and other details which underpin your tenancy. 

1. **Integrations.** The most important integration is with [Stripe.com](http://stripe.com). Specific instructions are [here](http://docs.hourfleet.com/provide.html)   

1. **Let's go!** If you're ready then [get started now](https://www.hourfleet.com/getstarted) by choosing a subscription plan and ordering your initial batch of car-kits
