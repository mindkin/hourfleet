# Introduction  

We're keen to see you get value for money from your Hourfleet subscription. So before you sign up, there are a few things you'll need to understand, and a few things you'll need to do. Some of this may be self-evident to you.

**1. Business plan, marketing, customer care and insurance.** It should come as no surprise that having a great platform like Hourfleet is only a very small part of your business success. If you're establishing a car sharing business then you're going to need to spend plenty of time on these things. You can work on them while you prepare your Hourfleet tenancy as guided below.

**2. Understanding an Hourfleet Tenancy.** You will need to host, create and maintain [your own landing page](yoursite.html) which are unique to your business. You can bespoke build this, or use tools like [Squarespace](http://squarespace.com), [Wix](htp://wix.com) or others.

**3. Configuring your Hourfleet Tenancy.** These are a large number of [configuration options](http://docs.hourfleet.com/youconfigure.html) which help you establish the branding, business rules and other details which underpin your tenancy. 

**4. Integrations.** The most important integration is with [Stripe.com](http://stripe.com). Specific instructions are [here](http://docs.hourfleet.com/youprovide.html)
