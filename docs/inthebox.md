# What You Are Going To Get

When you join Hourfleet, you get your own entire cloud-hosted online car sharing management platform, tailored to your business and tailored to your brand.

Your Car Share supports either P2P car sharing or more conventional B2C car sharing, or both! and there are many options which you can configure to your business.

Your Car Share includes the following main pieces:

1. A mobile responsive web App, that works on any device. Your customers will use this to make bookings for cars. You will use it register cars, and manage all the cars, users and billing. Head over to your new Car Share URL. It should look like `https://yourbusiness.hourfleet.com` or take a look at the [roamride.hourfleet.com](https://roamride.hourfleet.com/search) network
2. In-car keyless access technology. Physical digital devices that are fitted into the cars on your network. These devices allow people on your network who borrow the cars to unlock the car from their smartphone, and drive the car away without the need to organize and and exchange the car keys with the owner of the car. No keys, just secure smartphone access.
3. 2nd Tier support by Hourfleet support staff.
