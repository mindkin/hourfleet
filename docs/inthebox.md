# What You Are Going To Get

When you join Hourfleet, you get your own entire cloud-hosted online car sharing management platform, tailored to your business and your brand.

You will get a 'tenancy' on the Hourfleet platform. 

Your tenancy can be used to run a car sharing network that supports either P2P car sharing or more conventional B2C car sharing, or both! 

Your tenancy includes the following main pieces:

* A customizable, responsive web app, works on any device, that your customers use to find, and use cars. (see https://roamride.hourfleet.com/signin as an example)
* Keyless access technology. Devices that are fitted into the cars on your network that let borrowers have keyless access to the cars. No keys, just secure smartphone access.
* A management web app that you (the operator) will use to monitor and manage your car sharing network and those using it.
* 2nd Tier support by hourfleet support staff.

# What it Looks Like

You get a responsive web app that looks and works great on any device.
You can see an example of what that looks like at [roamride.hourfleet.com](https://roamride.hourfleet.com/signin) 

Want to try it out? Just [Join](https://roamride.hourfleet.com/invite) the roamride network and explore the app yourself. You don't need to do much to join, just your email, name and a password. You can search for cars, book a car, and even register your own car, if you like. Its a good way to kick the tyres and see what it all looks like.
