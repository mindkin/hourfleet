# What You Are Going To Get

When you join Hourfleet, you get your own entire cloud-hosted online car sharing management platform, tailored to your business and tailored to your brand.

You will get your own 'tenancy' on the Hourfleet platform. 

Your tenancy is used to run a car sharing network that supports either P2P car sharing or more conventional B2C car sharing, or both! and there are many options which you can configure to your business.

Your tenancy includes the following main pieces:

1. A device responsive web app, that works on any device, that your customers use. They use it to find, and use cars. As an example, see [The RoamRide car sharing network](https://roamride.hourfleet.com/signin)
2. In-car keyless access technology. Physical digital devices that are fitted into the cars on your network. These devices allow people on your network who borrow the cars to unlock the car from their smartphone, and drive the car away without the need to organise and and exchange the car keys with the owner of the car. No keys, just secure smartphone access.
3. A management web app that you (the operator) will use to monitor and manage your car sharing network and those using it.
4. 2nd Tier support by hourfleet support staff.

# What it Looks Like

You get a responsive web app that looks and works great on any device.
You can see an example of what that looks like at [roamride.hourfleet.com](https://roamride.hourfleet.com/signin) 

iPhone and ANdroid apps are coming soon.

Want to see what it looks like? 

Just [Join](https://roamride.hourfleet.com/invite) the roamride network and explore the app yourself. 
ANyone can join, you just need an email address, name and a password. You can search for cars, book a car, and even register your own car, if you like. Its a good way to kick the tyres and see what it all looks like.

The app for your network will look similar, with your own colors, icons and customizations.
