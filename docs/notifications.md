For key events in the system, users will recieve SMS and Email notifications. For example when they join your network, or when they reserve or book a car.
Here you can see an example of all the sms and email notifications that get sent and at which key events they happen.
If you would like to be notified of these events at the same time as your customers you can do this with Zapier Integration.
