# Notifications

For key events in Hourfleet, users will receive SMS and Email notifications. For example when they join your network, or when they book a car.
Here you can see an example of all the SMS and Email notifications that get sent and at which key events they happen.
If you would like to be notified of these events at the same time as your customers you can do this through Zapier Integration. To find out how to do this visit the [Zapier Integration](zapier.html) page. 

## Email Configuration

Some email elements are determined by your [Network Operator configuration file](configure.html) and will be the same across all the email notifications that are sent. In the image examples below references to 'Roam' by name, URLs or images will be replaced with your network counterpart.

**Email Headers**

![EmailPreview](images/EmailPreviews/emailHeaderExample.png)

The colour of your email header is determined by the `primary color` attribute in the branding section of your configuration file and is used across all emails.

The content in your email headers are separated onto two lines and is configured per email based on the context in which it is being sent.

**Email Footers**

![EmailPreview](images/EmailPreviews/emailFooterExample.png)

The configuration of your email footer is determined by values in your configuration file and is used across all emails.

- The *Roam* logo is replaced with the image provided for `DesktopImageUrl`
- The activity URL is replaced with the URL provided for `HomeUrl`
- The support URL is replaced with the URL provided for `Email` under the `Support/Company` section
- The social media icons link to the URL's provided under the `social` category. 
  **Note:** If you do not provide a URL for a particular platform, e.g. Twitter, the corresponding icon will not be displayed.

### Attempted Password Reset (User)
###### ID: 4010 

This notification is sent to the *Email Address* used when a *User* requests a password reset on an email address that is _NOT_ registered on your network. 

This email is sent as a courtesy to the email recipient, even though they have no account in your network. It is to alert them to the fact that someone (most likely an attacker) is trying to reset their password on your network. A common attack is to obtain an email address and password from a weakly protected site, and then try to find other sites where that password is used, and attempt a password reset to compromise that site. This email is simply notifying the email recipient of that possibility, which occasionally serves to attract new customers to your network because of the social service you have provided them.

There is no assocaited SMS for this email.
