# Lets' try out your new Car Share

You started your free 14 day trial, you created your own new Car Share, and you have registered your new account. **What do you do now?**

We recognise that it is not so easy to see what experience Hourfleet gives you and your customers once you have signed up. We are working on improving that with product videos and tutorials coming soon.

This will be our first-steps tutorial, that will walk you through your new App, create some user accounts, register a new car and even rent out your car.

You should get a good feel for how it all works, and see some of the features that Hourfleet supports for you and your customers, and understand a little more how things hang together. There is a lot here, so we will try to keep it brief, and you can explore the rest.

If you are more interested, we do explain some of the concepts of How Things Work over [here](howitworks.html), but its time to get hands on a see it in action.

Here is the plan for this walkthrough:

1. You have your operators account, but your customers will need their own accounts on your Car Share. So, we are going to create another account to represent one of your customers, who is going to borrow one of your cars.
2. Then we are going to register a car on your network. Don't worry, it does not have to be a _real_ car just yet. We are going to set it up for borrowing, and you can see some of the things that have to be in place for cars and their owners (you in this case).
3. Once your car is all set up, you are going to switch to acting as one of your customers, and go find and borrow your new car. You will then see how the booking system works and how the App helps guides your customers to borrowing their cars.
4. Finally, we are going to take the car offline, since you may or may not want others to use it on your network after this walkthrough.

So, let's get started.

## Setting up Accounts

By now, after creating your new Car Share, you should have received an invitation from your App, inviting you to join your Car Share.

In the email, there is a link, which if you click, sends you to the 'Create Account' page. You fill out your name, email and conviction status, declare yourself as not a robot and create your account, and you are logged into your Car Share App.

Now things may look a bit funny in the App because you have a special account called an 'Operator' account. An operator account has a lot of special privileges that other users in your Car Share will not have. Such as looking at financial reports and managing all the cars and users in your Car Share network.

Click on the 'Operations' menu item and you get to see some reports for your new Car Share. Its a bit bare at the moment though.

Your view of the App is quite different than a regular user of the App, but don't worry because all the things they see you can still get to in the menus and in the footer section of the App.

OK, so now its time to see what a regular customer of your will experience, using the App.

First, log out of the App, by clicking your name in the top right corner, and selecting 'Sign Out'. You will be returned to the 'Sign In' page.

## Create a new Borrower

Now, in the top right menu, select 'Join'. You will be presented with a page that asks for your email, and name. 

Now, you are going to make up a ficticious name of a person, enter it in here (First Name, Last Name) and use the email address: `hourfleet@mailinator.com`. Dont worry, this email address goes to a public email mailbox which you can use for this walkthrough. 

Click 'Join Now'.

An email gets whisked off to your ficticious person, inviting them to your Car Share. 

You can see that email arrive in the mainbox at [this website](https://www.mailinator.com/v3/index.jsp?zone=public&query=hourfleet#/#inboxpane). 
> Again, this is a public mailbox that anyone can see, and you may even see emails in this mailbox from others following this tutorial, but no problem. You are looking for an email that arrives from your Car Share to your ficticious person, that arrived 'Moments Ago'. It might take a minute or two, please be patient. No junk mail folder here!

Ok, open the email, and you will see a big button to click saying 'Create Account'. Click it.

You are grought back into your App at the 'Create Account' page, but this time you are your ficticious friend. Fill out the details, and click 'Create Now'.

Ok, now your ficticious friend is going to need to fill out some stuff.

Fill out the 'Mobile Number', Add the 'Drivers License'. You dont need to add the 'Credit Card' just yet. Don't panic.

For the 'Drviers License' just upload two pictures of anything at hand for now. They could be pictures of cats, or trees, whatever you can get images of right now. Does not have to be a picture of your actual license yet. Fill out the rest with fake but reasonable information.

Then on the left click the 'Profile' tab and add a profile avatar picture. It could be anything right now, your cat, your dog, a tree. Does not matter right now. Bu do say some words about your ficticious friend's 'Personal Description'. Try to keep this one reasonably real, because you are going to come across this person again in later in this tutorial.

OK, once that is done, you are now your ficticious person, which is cool. But right now, you cant do a lot except see cars on the map. Which right now has no cars!

In the top menu click 'Find a Car' and see the map of all cars, which you can move around and search for cars. Nothing there yet.

Let's go create a car.
