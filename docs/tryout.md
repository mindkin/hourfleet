# Lets' Try Out your new Car Share

You started your free 14 day trial, you created your own new Car Share, and you have registered your new account. **What do you do now?**

We recognise that it is not so easy to see what experience Hourfleet gives you and your customers once you have signed up. We are working on improving that with product videos and tutorials coming soon.

This will be our first-steps tutorial, that will walk you through your new App, create some user accounts, register a new car and even rent out your car.

You should get a good feel for how it all works, and see some of the features that Hourfleet supports for you and your customers, and understand a little more how things hang together. There is a lot here, so we will try to keep it brief, and you can explore the rest.

If you are more interested, we do explain some of the concepts of How Things Work over [here](howitworks.html), but its time to get hands on a see it in action.

Here is the plan:

1. You have your operators account, but your customers will need their own accounts on your Car Share. So, we are going to create another account to represent one of your customers, who is going to borrow one of your cars.
2. Then we are going to register a car on your network. Don't worry, it does not have to be a _real_ car just yet. We are going to set it up for borrowing, and you can see some of the things that have to be in place for cars and their owners (you in this case).
3. Once your car is all set up, you are going to switch to acting as one of your customers, and go find and borrow your new car. You will then see how the booking system works and how the App helps guides your customers to borrowing their cars.
4. Finally, we are going to take the car offline, since you may or may not want others to use it on your network after this walkthrough.

So, let's get started.
