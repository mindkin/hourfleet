# Lets' Try Out Your New Car Share

You started your free 14 day trial, you created your own new Car Share, and you have registered your new account. Now what do you do?

We recognise that it is not so easy to see what experience Hourfleet gives you and your customers once you have signed up. We are working on improving that with product videos and tutorials over time.

This is our first steps tutorial, that will walk you through the the App, create some user accounts, register a new car and rent out your car.

You should get a good feel for how it all works, and see some of the features that Hourfleet supports for you and your customers.

We do explain some of the concepts of How Things Work over [here](howitworks.html)], but its time to get hands on a see it in action.

Here is the plan:

1. You have your operators account, but your customers will need their own accounts. We are going to create another account to represent one of your customers, who is going to borrow one of your cars.
2. Then we are going to register a car on your network. Don't worry, it doe snot have to be a real car just yet. We are going to set it up for borrowing, and you can see some of the things that have to be in place for cars nd their owners (you in this case).
3. Once your car is all set up, you are going to switch to acting as one of your customers, and go borrow your new car. You will then see how the booking system works and how the App helps borrowers use their car.
4. Finally, we are going to take the car offline, since you may or may not want others to use it on your network.
