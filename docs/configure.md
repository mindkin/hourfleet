# What You Can Configure

When you join Hourfleet and create a new Car Share, you are going to get with that your own car sharing web App hosted for you at an address like: `https://yourbusiness.hourfleet.com`.

Your web app will need to be customized to suit your business model, and tailored to look like your company brand.

You can see an example of what your web app will look like at [What Is In The Box](inthebox.html)

# What Is a Network Operator?
From the perspective of Hourfleet, you (and your business) are known to Hourfleet as a "Network Operator", since you operate a car sharing 'network' on the Hourfleet platform. 

As a Network Operator you are very likely to have many things unique to your business, such as: your own brand, your own social media presence, and also different rules about how your price and charge your customers for renting and borrowing cars on your network.

You are very likely to already have your own website for your business that is focused upon capturing new customers and providing that all important front door to your business, to turn interested browsers into paying customers. 

You'll want to keep that website, and the Hourfleet web app will extend your website to provide all the tools you and your customers need to run your car sharing business.

There is lots to configure for your specific car sharing business and how the Hourfleet web app should look and behave. Let's get started.
