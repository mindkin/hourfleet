# Introduction  
Hourfleet is a fully featured car sharing platform and the Hourfleet App will help your customers register their accounts, register their cars, and book and use the cars in your Car Sharing network.

However, there is still a set of infromation your customers will need before they feel comfortable using your car sharing service.
This includes:

* A Terms of Service
* A Privacy Policy
* How It Works
* Insurance Details

At Hourfleet we know that your customers experience with you is best served by you providing this information from your own web site, and then making that infromation available to your customers where they need it, when they need it.

For this reason, you will need to host that information on your own website, and then configure your New Hourfleet car share to share that information with your customers.

As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words ... this is how it works:
