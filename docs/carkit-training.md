## Introduction

This section outlines how to start using your Tap Tap Go device. In time all this will become second nature, but for you and your customers getting accustomed to how this device operates will take a few practice runs. The purpose of this guide is to help you quickly become comfortable accessing your car using the Tap Tap Go device. We cover the how the device works, meaning of the LED light on the Tap Tap Go device, and some troubleshooting steps.

## How it works

The Tap Tap Go device has a camera designed specifically for reading QR codes. This camera is usually asleep as indicated by a blue (or red) slow flashing LED. When the device detects a double tap on the windscreen, it wakes up the camera which then starts looking for a QR code. This state is indicated by a pulsing green LED. If a valid QR key is presented, the LED starts flashing green and the car doors are unlocked or locked as appropriate.

Like any new gesture, and most of us remember getting to understand mobile phone tap and swipe gestures, it will take some practice to become a Tap Tap Go professional. Here are some tips:  
1. Hold the phone is portrait (normal) orientation, matching the Tap Tap Go device itself
2. Move the phone steadily towards the device camera. The device can't read closer than 2 inches (5cm), so don't place it right against the windscreen.
3. If your phone settings allow for screen re-orientation, be sure that the app (and QR image) is in portrait orientation when being presented to the QR camera.

> Note: It's good to practice, but don't request more than 20 _Unlock_ QR keys in one session. The device contains a number of unlock keys and these are refreshed periodically. If you use too many at once you may not be able to get into the car!


## Tap Tap Go LEDs

Each Tap Tap Go has a single LED (light) used to indicate its state.

- **No LED**: Tap Tap is disabled. Either the device is not correctly powered, or the car has detected vibrations over the last 5 seconds, such as vibrations from driving down the road. 
- **Red flashing (slow)**: Power is applied. The car kit is not yet configured, and is waiting to connect to Hourfleet over the internet, for which it needs cellular coverage.
- **Blue flashing** : Ready for normal lock/unlock operation.
- **Purple flashing** : The car kit is being configured by the Hourfleet.
- **Green pulsing**: Ready for presentation of a unlock/lock key, in response to a Tap Tap on the windscreen.
- **Green flashing**: A valid QR key has been presented. The car doors will unlock or lock as appropriate.
- **Red flashing (fast)**: An invalid QR key has been presented.  

 Take a moment to familiarize youeself with these. The 'usual' unlock or lock sequence is this:
 - Blue Flashing
 - Tap Tap on the windscreen
 - Green Pulsing. The unit is ready to have a unlock/lock QR key presented
 - Green Flashing. The unlock/lock QR key has been actioned.
